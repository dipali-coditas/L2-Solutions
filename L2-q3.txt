Create a machine image of the instance and create Autoscaling group / VMSS, put all instances behind the Load Balancer, generate traffic and let the instances scale from 1 to 10, release the load and the instance should scale back to 1 ((This is in continuation to Create a virtual machine, install apache server, write a simple HelloWorld App in PHP, host the app on Apache on VM question))




Certainly! If you want to use images instead of machine images for auto-scaling with a managed instance group, you can follow these modified steps:

### 1. Create an Image:

1. In the Google Cloud Console, go to "Compute Engine" > "VM instances."

2. Find the VM instance you created earlier.

3. In the row for your VM instance, click on the instance name.

4. Click on the "Stop" button to stop the instance.

5. After stopping the instance, click on the "Create Image" button.

6. Set a name for the image and click "Create."

### 2. Create an Instance Template:

1. In the Google Cloud Console, go to "Compute Engine" > "Instance templates."

2. Click on "+ CREATE INSTANCE TEMPLATE."

3. Set a name for the template.

4. In the "Boot disk" section, choose "Custom images" and select the image you created.

5. Configure other settings as needed and click "Create."

### 3. Create a Managed Instance Group:

1. In the Google Cloud Console, go to "Compute Engine" > "Instance groups."

2. Click on "+ CREATE INSTANCE GROUP."

3. Set a name for the instance group.

4. Choose "Unmanaged instance group" and click "Create."

5. In the "Instances" tab, add instances using the existing VM instance you created earlier.

### 4. Create a Load Balancer:

1. In the Google Cloud Console, go to "Network services" > "Load balancing."

2. Click on "+ CREATE LOAD BALANCER."

3. Choose "HTTP(S) Load Balancing."

4. Set a name for the load balancer.

5. Configure backend services by choosing the managed instance group created earlier.

6. Configure frontend services.

7. Complete the load balancer setup and click "Create."

### 5. Generate Traffic:

1. Get the IP address of your load balancer from the "Load balancing" page.

2. Open a web browser and access the IP address to generate traffic.

### 6. Observe Auto-Scaling:

1. In the Google Cloud Console, go to "Compute Engine" > "Instance groups."

2. Click on the instance group you created.

3. In the "Details" tab, you can see the number of instances.

4. Monitor the "Instance count" as you generate traffic.

### 7. Release Load:

1. Stop generating traffic to the load balancer.

2. Monitor the instance group and observe the auto-scaling behavior.

### 8. Observe Scaling Back:

1. After a period of no traffic, monitor the instance group.

2. Observe that the number of instances scales back down to the minimum.

This adjusted setup demonstrates the auto-scaling behavior of a managed instance group using images instead of machine images. Adjust the configurations based on your specific requirements.
