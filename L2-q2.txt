**Q: How can I set up an email alert in the Google Cloud Console GUI when someone opens my website from a specific IP address without using a load balancer?**

1. **Configure Log-Based Metric:**
   - **Step 1:** In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to "Logging."
   - **Step 2:** Construct a filter based on your log structure. For Apache logs, it might be something like `resource.type="gce_instance" AND textPayload:"34.93.42.56"`.
   - **Step 3:** Click "Create Metric," set a name for the metric, and create it.

2. **Create an Alert Policy:**
   - **Step 1:** In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to "Monitoring" > "Alerting."
   - **Step 2:** Click "+ CREATE POLICY."
   - **Step 3:** Set the "Condition" using "Metric Threshold" and choose the metric created earlier.
   - **Step 4:** In the "Configuration" section, set up conditions and notification channels.
   - **Step 5:** In "Notification channels," add an email channel.

3. **Create a Notification Channel for Email:**
   - **Step 1:** Go to "Monitoring" > "Notification channels."
   - **Step 2:** Click "+ CREATE CHANNEL."
   - **Step 3:** Choose "Email" as the type, enter your email address, and click "Add channel."

4. **Test the Setup:**
   - **Step 1:** Access your website from the specified IP address.
   - **Step 2:** Monitor Cloud Monitoring for alerts and check your email for the alert.

This setup uses Cloud Monitoring, Cloud Logging, and a log-based metric to trigger email alerts when an access log entry matches the specified criteria. Adjustments may be needed based on your specific log structure.
