For managing storage in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with the described pattern of data usage, you can consider the following smart solution:

### 1. Storage Service:
Google Cloud offers various storage services, and for your use case, you can leverage a combination of the following:

#### a. **Cloud Storage:**
   - **First Week:** Use a higher-performance storage class like `Standard` or `Nearline` for the initial data ingest, providing low-latency access.
   - **Second Week:** Transition the data to a cheaper storage class like `Coldline` or `Archive` since access frequency is reduced.
   - **Third Week:** For data that is no longer actively used, consider archiving it using `Nearline`, `Coldline`, or `Archive` storage classes.

#### b. **BigQuery:**
   - For analytical queries or data analysis, consider loading the data into BigQuery. It is a fully-managed, serverless data warehouse with fast SQL queries and built-in machine learning capabilities.

### 2. Automation:
   - Leverage Cloud Storage Object Lifecycle Management to automatically transition objects between storage classes based on age or other criteria.

### 3. Security Considerations:
   - **Encryption:**
     - Enable encryption at rest for Cloud Storage to protect your data. This is done by default for most storage classes.
     - Consider using customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) for added control over your keys.

   - **Access Control:**
     - Use Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) to control and manage access to your storage resources.
     - Implement the principle of least privilege, ensuring that users and services have only the necessary permissions.

   - **Audit Logging:**
     - Enable Cloud Audit Logs to monitor and log access to your storage resources, helping in compliance and security investigations.

   - **Network Security:**
     - Use Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Service Controls to define security perimeters around Google Cloud services, limiting data access.

   - **Monitoring and Alerts:**
     - Set up Cloud Monitoring and Cloud Logging to monitor storage-related metrics and receive alerts based on predefined thresholds.

### 4. Cost Optimization:
   - Monitor and analyze your storage costs using tools like the Cloud Storage Pricing Calculator. Adjust your storage classes and configurations based on usage patterns.

### 5. Data Deletion:
   - Implement a data retention policy to automatically delete or archive data after a certain period, especially for data that is not accessed beyond a specific timeframe.

### 6. Regular Review:
   - Regularly review your storage usage patterns and adjust your storage strategies accordingly.

By combining Cloud Storage with intelligent lifecycle management, leveraging BigQuery for analytics, and following security best practices, you can create a cost-effective and secure storage solution for your application in GCP.
