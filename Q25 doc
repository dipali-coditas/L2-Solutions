To run this code on GCP, only a few changes would be needed:

Specify your GCP project ID:
# project = "my-project-id"

Authenticate
When running locally, do:

# gcloud auth application-default login

Install dependencies
Locally:
# pip install google-cloud-compute

On GCP services add requirements.txt:
# google-cloud-compute

Pass a valid VM IP address to delete

So the only major changes needed are:

Specify GCP project ID
Authenticate your environment
Install the google cloud compute library
Provide a valid VM IP address to delete
